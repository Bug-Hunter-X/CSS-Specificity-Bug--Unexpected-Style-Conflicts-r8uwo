The solution is to understand and apply the CSS selector specificity rules effectively. In the example above, to ensure that the `.container div` styles override the `div` styles, increase the specificity of the `.container div` selector or modify the order.  Consider these options:

1. **Increased Specificity:** Using a more specific selector, such as `div.container` or even including a more specific parent element. This creates a more precise selector, resulting in the styles taking higher priority.

2. **Order of Styles:** In some cases the ordering of style definitions in the CSS file can influence which rule takes precedence if specificity is equal.  Place the more specific styles later in your file.

```css
div {
  color: blue; /* This will be overridden */
}

.container div {
  color: red; /* This now correctly overrides the div selector */
}

#specific-div {
  color: green; /* This will also be overridden */
}

#specific-div.container {
  color: purple; /* This will remain as it has highest priority*/
}
```

By understanding these rules and applying them correctly, you can prevent this type of bug and ensure that your CSS styles are applied as intended.
