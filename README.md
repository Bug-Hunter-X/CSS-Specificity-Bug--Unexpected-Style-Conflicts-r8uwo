# CSS Specificity Bug: Unexpected Style Conflicts

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to CSS selector specificity that can lead to unexpected styling issues. The bug arises from a misunderstanding of how CSS resolves style conflicts when multiple selectors apply to the same element. 

## Bug Description
The main issue is related to the way CSS handles specificity when multiple selectors target the same element, particularly when using ID and class selectors in combination.  A lack of understanding of how specificity works can create unexpected style conflicts that are difficult to debug.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.css` and `bugSolution.css` to examine the code.
3. Observe the difference in styling between the two CSS files.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully considering selector specificity and utilizing more specific selectors where necessary to ensure the intended style is applied.
